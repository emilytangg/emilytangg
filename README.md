### Hi :)
My name is Emily and I'm working on my programming skills! 
Some goals that I would like to achieve in 2022 are to:
* Learn JavaScript and React.js
* Learn about object-oriented programming by exploring how it works in Python 
* Improve my skills and knowledge in working with data structures and algorithms
* Complete at least 1 personal project - either a game, personal website or something else altogether!
